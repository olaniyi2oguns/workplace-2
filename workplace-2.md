## CONFIGURING NGINX TO USE PHP PROCESSOR

`lempstackproject was used as domain name. Therefore, a directory was created for it by running the command "sudo mkdir /var/www/lempstackproject"`

`To create owner for the directory, I run command "sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/lempstackproject"`

`Then, I created a configuration file in Nginx's sites-available directory using nano command as command-line editor and I run command "sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/lempstackproject"`

`I then create a new blank file by running the command below:`

```
{#/etc/nginx/sites-available/lempstackproject

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name lempstackproject www.lempstackproject;
    root /var/www/lempstackproject;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
     }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

}

}
```

`I then tested my configuration for syntax error by running command "sudo nginx -t"`

`The image below shows the commands I run and the output I got when I tested my configuration.`

`I disabled the default Nginx host by running command "sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-available/default" and I reloaded the Nginx with command "sudo systemctl reload nginx"`

`To confirm that my configuration is workin as expected, I created a new index.html file in the var/www/lempstackproject as it was initially empty`

`So, I added the command "sudo echo 'Hello LEMP from hostname' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname) 'with public IP' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) > /var/www/lempstackproject/index.html"`
